## What is this?!!

This is the source code for an UNESCO World Heritage site viewer I made, hosted on https://jelmar.eu/whc. I made this because I wanted to know more about World Heritage sites, what and where they were, but the [official UNESCO map viewer](https://whc.unesco.org/en/interactive-map/) *sucks*. Actually, it appears to be completely broken now. I think information about our common heritage should be accessible to everyone, and UNESCO is doing a pretty terrible job right now.
